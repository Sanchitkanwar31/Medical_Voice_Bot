# Medical Vision and Voice Chatbot

A multi-phase AI-powered healthcare chatbot designed to simulate a voice-based interaction between a **patient** and a **virtual doctor**. Built using Python, speech recognition, TTS, and Gradio for a user-friendly interface.

---

##  Project Overview

The chatbot is structured into **4 modular phases**, each handling a distinct part of the interaction:

| Phase       | Component                             | Script                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------| ------------------------- |
| **Phase 1** |  Brain of the Doctor (LLM logic )     | `brain_of_the_doctor.py`  |
| **Phase 2** |  Voice of the Patient (Speech ‚Üí Text) | `voice_of_the_patient.py` |
| **Phase 3** |  Voice of the Doctor (Text ‚Üí Speech)  | `voice_of_the_doctor.py`  |
| **Phase 4** |  Gradio Frontend Interface            | `front_app.py`            |
